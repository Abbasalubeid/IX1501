## Intended learning outcomes

### General Objectives

After course completion the student should be able to:

1. formulate, analyze and solve problems in statistics significant to in the ICT sphere.
2. apply and develop statistical models with the aid of mathematical programming language.
3. review and comment a given solution to a problem.
4. comment domain and propose improvements to a statistical model.
5. make presentations of solutions of a statistical problem.

### Detailed Objectives

After course completion the student should be able to:

1. apply basic stochastic models and use these to determine summary measures and probabilities.
2. use normal approximation according to CLT.
3. apply basic statistical models to an experiment.
4. specify a standard model and comment the fitness for given data.
5. describe data with summary measures, such as mean, variance and covariance.
6. compute point estimates and confidence intervals.
7. estimate error risks in hypothesis testing.
